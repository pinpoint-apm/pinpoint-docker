## Requirements

- [docker 18.02.0+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)

## How to install Pinpoint?

You can easily bring up an entire Dockerized Pinpoint(latest release) environment by using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) with any of the provided `docker-compose.yml` files  as below.  
With `docker-compose.yml` under *Pinpoint-Docker* folder brings up all the environment attached with Pinpoint-QuickStart(sample app).
To monitor your agent see [configuration part](#configurations) for further details.  

```
git clone https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-docker.git
cd pinpoint-docker
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```
If you'd like to bring up a previous release. Try with docker-compose file from other tags. 

```
git clone https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-docker.git
cd pinpoint-docker
git checkout {tag}
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

You can also build the image with `docker-compose up -d` command without pulling the image. But you can reduce the time to 1/3 by just downloading them.

This will install and run all services required to run all features in Pinpoint in docker containers joined with same network.
 - Pinpoint-Web Server
 - Pinpoint-Collector
 - Pinpoint-Agent
 - Pinpoint-Flink(to support certain feature)
 - Pinpoint-Zookeeper
 - Pinpoint-Hbase
 - Pinpoint-QuickStart(a sample application, 1.8.1+)
 - Pinpoint-Mysql(to support certain feature)
 - Pinpoint-Batch
This may take several minutes to download all necessary images.

You can replace `QuickStart` application part with your application to start monitoring.  
 - check [`Testing QuickStart application`](#testing-quickstart-application) for a quick demo of pinpoint
 - check [`Monitoring YOUR Application`](#monitoring-your-application) part for further details

### Mysql (optional, 1.8.1+)

The Pinpoint-Mysql is necessary to use 'Alarm' feature. It's server is running on port 13306 and contains the data structure used to register users, groups, and alerts to be sent.

To send email alerts, you must make BATCH_ENABLE=true and change the other mail-related environment variables (MAIL_HOST, MAIL_PORT, MAIL_USERNAME, MAIL_PASSWORD, MAIL_PROPERTIES_MAIL_SMTP_FROM, ...) to the Pinpoint-Web server in *.env* file.

For more information checkout [Setting Alarm](http://pinpoint-apm.github.io/pinpoint/alarm.html) in Pinpoint documentation.

### Flink configuration (optional)

The Pinpoint-Flink is necessary to use ['Application Inspector'](https://pinpoint-apm.github.io/pinpoint/applicationinspector.html) feature. 

After all containers are started and ready to go. Pinpoint-Flink server is running on [port 8081](http://localhost:8081/). 

### Alarm configuration (optional)

You can check the [alarm guide document at the homepage](https://pinpoint-apm.github.io/pinpoint/alarm.html) for full understanding.
But for the docker image, All is set. fillout variables under *#mail server information required* in `.env` file before starting the container 
 
### Testing QuickStart application
 
Now you are ready to monitor the sample application(Pinpoint-QuickStart [port 8085](http://localhost:8085)) provided.
If you can't find any connected application from Pinpoint-Web's first page([port 8080](http://localhost:8080) as default), don't panic and wait for a while.
It will take some time for Pinpoint to retrieve the application's information when running for the first time.

## Monitoring YOUR Application

Pinpoint-Agent only prepares required libraries for triggering Pinpoint-Agent.
Running and configuring agents is manual action done by the user, but don't worry it's very simple.

If you are not familiar with Pinpoint concept, please read: [Overview](https://pinpoint-apm.github.io/pinpoint/overview.html#architecture),
[Agents Installation](https://pinpoint-apm.github.io/pinpoint/installation.html#5-pinpoint-agent)

**You will need to attach *Pinpoint-Agent* to your application.**

Running Pinpoint-Agent docker-compose separately, Examples are [here](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-docker/tree/master/pinpoint-agent-attach-example).  
Otherwise, you can check how [Pinpoint-Quickstart](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) is attached to Pinpoint-Agent with docker-compose.

We'll try to create more examples along the way.
If anyone who can share their dockerfile, it's always welcome.

## Distributed System

Until now, every components are in one docker, single-node approach, which is excellent for test and development.
It provides an easy way to prototype new ideas and use cases, as well as try out new functionality and the latest Pinpoint releases.
Itâ€™s not intended nor supported for production use.

You can use `docker-compose` and `.env` files under each folder to install the modules separately into several servers.
If containers are separated, ip configurations in `.env` must be changed within. 

For example, if you want your application running from a docker and rest of Pinpoint in another.
You can remove *pinpoint-agent* and *pinpoint-quickstart* from docker-compose.yml and run to establish all necessary component of pinpoint.
And create another docker-compose.yml just like one under pinpoint-quickstart folder to run your application.
Finally, since agent needs to acknowledge the collector ip. collector ip needs to be changed in .env.

## Configurations

Configuration relies on supplying `docker-compose` with environment variables defined in `.env` file. So it's recommended to change variables only from `.env` file.
With `docker-compose` in this repository. You can create stand-alone containers that are needed to run most of the features in Pinpoint.

**Ports** can be also configured in .env file.
(Default ports are Pinpoint-Web:8080, Pinpoint-Batch:8079, Quickstart:8085 and Flink:8081 as configured in .env file)

Pinpoint-Zookeeper is just an example of using zookeeper image. You can modify docker-compose files to suit your needs.

For more specific details on what the values represents in *.env* file. Please check [Pinpoint Github Repository](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint) or
[Pinpoint Web properties](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint/blob/master/web/src/main/resources/pinpoint-web-root.properties), [Pinpoint Collector properties](httpshttps://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint/blob/master/collector/src/main/resources/pinpoint-collector-root.properties), [Pinpoint Agent configuration](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint/blob/master/agent/src/main/resources/pinpoint-root.config).  
Please note that only essential configuration options are adopted to pinpoint-docker(docker-compose). 
 
## logs 
 
You can check logs produced by these services
 ```
 docker logs <containerId>
 ```
 
You can also easily change the log level from *.env* file.
